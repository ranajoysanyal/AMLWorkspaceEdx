Hi Violeta,
I really appreciate you reaching out to listen to our org; it demonstrates that you really care about our org and are committed to driving positive changes across our org.  Thank you!

As a follow-up to our 1:1 a while back, below are the examples I would like to share about Priya. For each example, I have also put in my perspective (<Ranajoy> </Ranajoy> tag). I have been facing major issues working with Priya, especially over the last 2-3 months, and remain committed to helping you make our org better. I would be happy to set up a follow-up 1:1 with you as well if you would like to discuss further. 
Also, if I may, I would like to call out that the SNAP SWE Leads would also have valuable perspectives on Priya. I know you are super busy, but gathering perspectives from the SNAP SWE Leads might give you invaluable insights (if you haven’t done so already)


Here are the top areas where I have major concerns with Priya’s leadership:
Taking credit on to herself, and looking to blame others
Always trying to look good in front of folks who can have a big impact on her career
Complete lack of listening skills and being closed to different perspectives
Forming her own story to support her opinion and using misinformation to support it
Panic under any sort of pressure
I would also like to call out that over the last month or so, I have also seen multiple examples where Priya seems intent on finding fault in my work, to the point where she is forming her own story and using misinformation to justify her opinion (examples below). 


Here are the examples in chronological order (oldest one first). I have put the examples in chronological order (instead of grouping them by feedback area) so I can paint a complete and comprehensive picture; also, some of the examples come under multiple areas:
Late 2017: When I was considering the idea of taking up the WiNET feature PM role, I asked Priya where she believes there would be more room for growth for me – DCNet servicing work or WiNET AB work (there was no discussion about WiNET servicing work being owned by me then); she had unhesitatingly said the WiNET AB work. However, for the last ~3 months, she has kept on telling me that the WSD CFE org focus is on servicing work, and I need to showcase my servicing skills to be successful in the org – even when I have been chartered to focus on Active Branch work exclusively. <Ranajoy> example of Priya giving the wrong guidance to her team and changing her stance whenever needed to align with her opinion </Ranajoy>
•	RS5 planning (early 2018): Priya gives confusing messages every time about how to parent and mark RS5 scenarios, and refuses to listen to any inputs. She confidently tells me that WDG policy mandates that that each Deliverable should have a Measure, which is completely incorrect (the recommendation is for each Scenario to have a Measure). <Ranajoy> I completely agree that being a part of WSD and trying to align with the WDG AB processes is not easy, but I would expect a PM lead to have an open mind, not share misinformation and listen to perspectives when she is not aware of the details </Ranajoy>
•	Jan 2018: a crucial part of my engagement with the Azure DNS team has been to set up an Azure support engagement for WinDNS. When I was discussing my proposed high level workflow with Rick and Priya over email, Rick mentioned we should get Windows GES involved. I explicitly asked Rick and Priya over email if there has been any precedent so I can get the learnings from it; Rick mentioned that he does not know, and it might be a good chance to induce the discussion (great point). Priya did not say a word on the email thread about this even though she responded on another point being discussed. It was only much later that I got to know she has lots of background about previous efforts that had been made to have Windows support involved in discussions with Azure support – efforts that have not been successful. She brought all of it up during a 1:1 discussion later on a different topic. <Ranajoy> example of Priya not calling out anything that counters a point raised by someone (Rick in this case) who she believes can have a direct impact on her career; example of Priya not supporting her team or sharing the right guidance even when she has additional information </Ranajoy>
•	Feb 2018: Manish and me were slated to give a presentation  to Carlos on Thursday 1st Feb with a status update and our recommendation for the RRAS as IaaS support work prototyped in RS4. Priya told me the week before that she would recommend not adding support and would like to continue the work to stay as a PoC. Manish and me talked in detail on Monday, and made a decision that based on the current level of info we have, we would like to recommend explicitly adding support. We made our slide deck accordingly, and presented to Rick and Priya on Tuesday 1/30. Priya had valid feedback on the deck, which we discussed and incorporated. She did not say anything about not being in-line with our recommendation, and we decided in the meeting to go ahead with the recommendation of explicitly adding the support statement for WS2016+ Servers. On Wednesday 1/31 evening, when Priya and me were talking 1:1, she said she will NOT support us in the room with Carlos with our recommendation; she said she had Implicitly mentioned this multiple times during the meeting on Tuesday. <Ranajoy> Imagine my surprise! Why is Priya not voicing her disagreement to a decision in a meeting with her SNAP dev manager counterpart, component SWE lead and component PM owner, where the explicit purpose of the meeting is to arrive at a decision to present to Carlos? I fail to understand what an “implicit” rejection means </Ranajoy> Eventually, we talked some more and reached a consensus. She then said that she only made the statement to me about not supporting us in the room with Carlos as like a “strong” statement. <Ranajoy> I am super confused at the conflicting messages from her, this is an example of Priya not giving any sort of proper guidance to her team; also, this is an example of Priya not voicing her opposition to our slide deck explicitly in the meeting to go contrary to what Rick had in mind </Ranajoy>
•	Meeting with Carlos on 1st Feb: Priya jumped in to read out what is written in the slide deck without giving me the opportunity to speak (around the crucial servicing agreement and support cost point that I had driven). <Ranajoy> example of Priya constantly looking to take credit in front of management, especially Carlos <Ranajoy>
•	6th Feb: in the quarterly All Hands, when Priya called out AutoRI, she mentioned Rahul (the dev owner), and did not bring up my name as the PM owner at all. <Ranajoy> yes, I agree Rahul is awesome and I love working with him, but I would expect a PM lead to give due credit to the work her PM is doing </Ranajoy>
•	6th Feb  communication on FOD plans for RS5: when John Cable reaches out to Priya asking for the RS5 status on converting 3 components RAS, TAPI and SNMP to FOD-s (Cable had in turn being asked by the FUN PM director), Priya called out to Cable that they are in plan for RS5, which was not the understanding from Rick, Manish or me; Rick also clearly called out that the decision to NOT do FOD work for TAPI and SNMP was upheld by Carlos. Priya then emailed saying “I think Ranajoy only communicated that TAPI is at risk to the FUN PM.” which is not entirely true. I had emailed to the FUN PM with Rick and Priya on the email thread “After further discussions with our WSD SNAP Duo Leadership, we would not like to invest in converting TAPI and SNMP into FOD-s in the RS5 timeframe; ……” <Ranajoy> example of Priya not supporting her team, and sharing misinformation to support her opinion. Also example of Priya trying to look good in front of management, John Cable in this case </Ranajoy>
•	7th Feb  periodic sync with Rick, Manish and me on Active Branch work
o	Priya asks me aggressively in the meeting to check with the FOD FUN PM Deepika why Deepika involved her PM director, who in turn involved Cable. She looked and acted super agitated that Cable had sent her an email. <Ranajoy> example of Priya getting into Panic mode very quickly, and looking to blame someone else </Ranajoy>
o	When I brought up the notes from the discussion with Carlos and the discussion came to the SAPP model, she basically said “I provided you that text” about SAPP being packages pre-req ed on the last LCU. This is a gross exaggeration; in her raw notes shared with me, Priya had only said “SAPP model”. It was me who put in the additional detail. <Ranajoy> example of Priya trying to take credit and using misinformation to do so </Ranajoy>
o	Throughout the meeting, she never let me call out my points at all, interrupting me before I had spoken like 1 full sentence; to the point, where I had to tell her to please let me complete.  <Ranajoy> I don’t remember the last person whom I have to request to please let me complete. Example of Priya’s complete lack of listening skills  </Ranajoy>
•	1st March: AzDNS team Partner Dev manager Natalia sent an email requesting us to re-send the ICM process while I was having lunch; I planned to come back from lunch and share that with her. However, Priya jumped in and responded with the same thing I had shared earlier, she later told me she had copy pasted from my email. <Ranajoy> example of Priya always trying to look good in front of Partner level folks </Ranajoy> 
•	13th March: SNAP shiproom, smaller audience discussing leveraging CSS for cases reported by Azure which are currently coming directly to WSD and randomizing the team  Priya raised the point that GES must be involved; it is a very fair point, but she was refusing to hear any other perspectives at all and cut me off several times almost immediately after I said like 2 words; my perspective was that that Azure partners are coming for RS5 fixes, which GES can not handle. It was only after multiple efforts that I could get this point across <Ranajoy> example of Priya not being willing to listen at all and being closed to different perspectives </Ranajoy>
•	14th March: Cloud PM team meeting 
o	The Cloud PM team meeting was from 12:30 to 1:30; there was a conflicting 12 – 1 PM meeting about “Day in the life of an EE” being presented to “SNAP FTE All” by a visiting EE Tom Fairman; the calendar invite was sent to “WSD CFE SNaP FTE” of which Priya is obviously a member, but she claimed that she did not have the invite. <Ranajoy> She might have very well – and justifiably - declined the invite due to calendar conflicts, but denying she even had the invite seems like misinformation to me </Ranajoy>
o	Some of us were in the EE meeting; among them, Doug and I came back to join the Cloud PM meeting around 12:35, Jeff and Usha were still in the EE meeting. Priya demanded aggressively that Jeff and Usha MUST be in this Cloud PM team meeting because it is MORE IMPORTANT than attending the EE meeting. <Ranajoy> example of Priya not being willing to listen at all and being closed to different perspectives; example of Priya not trusting her team to make the right call in terms of their priorities </Ranajoy>
o	In addition, Priya said Jeff MUST be in the Cloud PM meeting because Jeff and Doug need to sort out how O365 escalations to WSD CFE team need to happen. As a brief background, Doug handles the O365 interaction with WSD, and there was a case very recently when he raised a Critsit from O365 for Jeff’s team; Jeff did not agree that it should be a critsit and neither did SNAP shiproom. All of us who were in SNAP shiproom were aware of this. Priya insisted that Jeff and Doug are Senior PM-s, and in THIS MEETING IN FRONT OF THE REST OF THE TEAM, they need to sort out what should happen. She also aggressively called out Doug in front of the whole team <Ranajoy> in a manner that I personally found embarrassing; they teach you in trainings that you should never bash up anyone – not just your team – in public. Not only that, IMHO she effectively tried to set up her 2 Senior PM-s in her own team against each other. Both the Senior PM-s showed much more maturity, and made sure things did not get ugly </Ranajoy>
•	14th March AB sync meeting (Manish, Rick, Priya, me): the 4 of us were having a very open discussion about the best way forward for DNS considering the concerns raised by Carlos. I wanted to present my perspective, and she cut me off before I had said like 5 words. When she finished, I just said “OK” ; it was Rick who then encouraged me to call out my perspective as well. <Ranajoy> Getting cut off multiple times in multiple forums by my lead is an incredibly frustrating experience. Example of Priya not being willing to listen at all and being closed to different perspectives </Ranajoy>
•	Friday 4th May Priya : Ranajoy 1:1 
o	Priya told me that she actually had to move me out of DCNet because the dev team wanted faster responses on emails to customers and were finding it hard to work with me. This was completely news to me and Priya had never mentioned it before. I then went had a word with Rick on Monday; he mentioned that the concern coming from some of the DCNet Dev-s about the responsiveness of the DCNet Duo is not unique to the PM or even unique to me as the PM. In late 2017, when I was considering WiNET AB PM role, Priya had explicitly told me that she believes there is more room for growth for a Senior PM in the WiNET AB space as opposed to the DCNet Servicing space. Priya had also mentioned that the exclusive AB PM role is an experiment, and I had agreed to help out the team by taking on this experimental role <Ranajoy> example of Priya having already made up her mind and trying to form her own  story to support her opinion </Ranajoy>
o	In almost every 1:1 for like the last 3 months, Priya kept on telling me that Tom, Rick and DCNet dev team had told her that I am not responsive to customer queries (be it from GES / MSRC / MS internal partners). Till date, she has not shared a single example that has come from Tom, Rick or the DCNet dev team. Yes, there was an example late last year for an unusual critsit where I could have done better (I had already de-escalated it so it was no longer a WSD critsit but it showed up on a WDG Server Leadership report, and got heat from there; I had made an incorrect assumption regarding the level of communication needed since in my mind it was no longer a WSD critsit), but this example came from Priya herself. When I requested her today about specific examples from the DCNet Dev team, she agitatedly said something like “I can't go prepare a dossier for you” <Ranajoy> an integral part of feedback, especially the ones coming from your lead, is to make it data driven so that it is clearly actionable, but Priya refuses to share any example and continues forming her own story to support her opinion without any concrete examples </Ranajoy>
o	Early 2018 immediately after picking up the WiNET AB work, I drove a decision on the prototype work done in RS4 timeframe to support RRAS on Azure as an IaaS instance. Priya asked me today “did you already have a decision made up in your mind when you started driving towards the decision”? I told her that I was focused on engaging with all the different stakeholders (WDG VPN client team, Azure VPN gateway team, Azure networking support, WDG commercial support, WSD RRAS Server feature team, WSD leadership), taking their inputs and then driving towards the right decision for Microsoft and for our customers - as opposed to having a pre-set opinion of my own at the very beginning. She kept insisting that I should have had a decision made beforehand even before approaching our various partners <Ranajoy> example of Priya trying to form her own story to support her opinion and trying to find fault in my work; example of her not being open to  perspectives </Ranajoy>
	Priya also mentioned that I should have done better in the first meeting with Carlos where he had pushed back on doing the prototype; I called out that I don’t recollect being in such a meeting (since I was on bonding leave) but she insisted that I was in the meeting, and I should have done better. I later checked with Manish, and he confirmed that I was not in any of those earlier meetings with Carlos; I also went back to check my calendar and did not find any calendar invite that I could have attended. <Ranajoy> example of Priya using misinformation to support her opinion </Ranajoy>
o	Priya had told me earlier that Manish also had feedback I was not responsive to emails; again she gave no specific examples. With my innate desire to improve, I talked to Manish later, and he mentioned that he does not see it as an issue at all, but is more a constructive feedback. Even in his perspective, he clearly says responsiveness to email is not an issue <Ranajoy> example of Priya forming her own story to support her opinion that I am not responsive to emails and then looking at perspectives as a way of blaming me </Ranajoy>
o	AutoRI : Priya kept insisting we were not following the plan we had set. When I requested her for additional info as to why she thinks so, she asked about the integration of AutoRI with AWE. I told her clearly that in both RS4 and RS5 we had committed to and got her and Rick's sign off  on exactly what we were going to do, and it has included as assessment of AWE integration for AutoRI in the RS5 timeframe. Then she said so why isn’t downlevel supported in AutoRI after RS4? I called out that in RS4, we had clearly set out to support AutoRI for Win10+ platforms only, and not below Win10, *and* that we achieved that. <Ranajoy> example of Priya forming her own story to support her opinion that AutoRI work was not done properly, using misinformation to support it and trying to find fault in my work </Ranajoy>
o	WSD servicing cost reduction for WINS : Priya kept insisting I should have been focusing more on it in RS5 in stead if other committed RS5 work. I reminded her that we had done a comprehensive RS5 planning exercise where we ranked WINS very low (299) as something we might look at later in RS5 cycle if we have time, and she (and Rick) had signed off on it. She kept insisting WINS should be done over DNS work. <Ranajoy> If she really thought this was the case, I would expect her to call it out and help us set the right priorities way during the extensive RS5 planning phase itself. Example of Priya forming her own story to support her opinion and trying to find fault in my work </Ranajoy>
o	When I ask her on how I can grow in servicing org, she consistently says process improvements. She said earlier in the discussion that Senior PM-s in the org should not be doing only execution, but strategy work as well (which is a great point), but later in the discussion on growth, she said I should drive the execution of servicing work really well, and do process improvements. <Ranajoy> example of Priya not having any sort of proper guidance for the growth of her team </Ranajoy>
o	When I explicitly called out that AB work and Servicing work in WiNET is more than 1 PM job, she blamed me for not having committed to lesser AB work in RS5. Note that Priya had made the decision in late 2017 that AB work and WiNET servicing work can not be done by 1 PM alone; the workload has not changed much since then, in fact the amount of AB work being done in RS5 is much more than what was done in RS4. She (along with Rick) had also signed off on our RS5 plans way back this year during the extensive RS5 planning cycle. <Ranajoy> Till very recently, the plan was always to have 1 exclusive AB PM, but now that she has decided to have the same PM handle servicing work, she is blaming me for having picked up the necessary volume of AB work. Example of Priya forming her own story to support her opinion and trying to find fault in my work </Ranajoy>

•	May 11th: my team and me are working on a Sev 1 ICM 68895813. I discuss in SNAP shiproom at 10 AM, have a plan in place for public documentation, am already closely engaged with GES for the text we would like to update in Known Issues section in the Release notes, have sent the WSDSwat email clearly calling out that Public Comms Update Acknowledge is in progress with an ETA of EOD. After sending the emails, I went to grab a late lunch at around 1:20 PM with the intent of sending the email to our Release Notes owners immediately after lunch with the text they need to update. As I come back from lunch in around 30 minutes, I see Manish and Usha (fellow PM in Priya’s team) on the phone with Chris Morrissey and Shellyann Rose; I have no clue what is happening, and then Manish does the right thing to call me into the room to listen in. Imagine my surprise when I realize there is a discussion going on about the Release Notes update for the ICM Incident that I own. Once the meeting is over, I get to know from Manish and Usha that Priya came in almost immediately after Carlos’ email in a super agitated state demanding that the Release Notes update happen immediately and asking where I were; when Manish mentioned I was out for lunch, she went talked to Usha and asked her to pitch in immediately. She told them Carlos and Chris Morrissey have been pinging her for an update ASAP, and she could not wait for me to get back from lunch. Note that Priya had also responded to Carlos that the plan to update the release notes is in progress and I was working on it. <Ranajoy> example of Priya not being able to handle any sort of pressure and getting into panic mode easily </Ranajoy>
o	Later I got to know that Priya explicitly wanted to get added to the email discussion about the Release Notes update since she wants to update Carlos. Later once the Release Notes are updated, she is the one who sends email to Carlos with the update. I have seen this example in another Incident handled by her team as well <Ranajoy> example of Priya always wanting to take credit in front of management, especially Carlos. </Ranajoy>
•	May 11th 5PM: I had just sent an email update about my Incident. When Carlos asked in a forked thread with Daryl and Priya if we have looked at all the data and saying no weekend work is needed might be premature, Priya immediately walked over to my office in an agitated state, saying “why did you say no weekend work? Now Carlos is upset”. <Ranajoy> Imagine my surprise at this because I had clearly communicated to Priya earlier and also mentioned in the overall status email thread including Priya that no weekend work is needed from my team for this Incident </Ranajoy>. She then said something like “why did you have to communicate no weekend work to Carlos”. <Ranajoy> I am super confused now as to where this is leading. Should I not be sending the right expectations with my exec management as well? Example of Priya getting into Panic mode very quickly, not being able to handle any pressure at her level, trying to blame me when anything happens where she is not looking good in front of her management, especially Carlos </Ranajoy>
•	May 15th SNAP shiproom: my team continues to actively work on the same Incident with a clear plan of action; there has been lots of confusion about another different issue, and we have been actively working on keeping the 2 issues separate; I had also put a note in the ICM saying “Issue reported by US Bank yesterday is a different case, and will be tracked separately.”. Today, Priya just picked up the word “US Bank” in this comment, and directly told me in shiproom “so you have confused the 2 cases”. <Ranajoy> example of Priya trying to find fault in my work and putting blame on me </Ranajoy>. 
•	SNAP shiproom early May: Priya called out that there have been MSRC bugs marked under the SNAP root, and she has been watching them for 1 month without doing anything, but still no body from the team had picked them up.  <Ranajoy> I am not sure what message Priya was trying to communicate here; is it her trying to show how crucial her work is, or trying to blame her PM team, or something else? </Ranajoy>
