Trip plan – Victoria BC
Trip focus: weekend getaway, good food J

Traveled in mid April 2016

 

Day 1

·         Ferry from Vancouver (schedule)

·         Seaward buffet Lunch in ferry

·         Check-in to hotel (Inn at Laurel Point) in the afternoon

·         White Heather Tea Room at 3:30 PM

 

Day 2

·         Lunch at 12 PM at Bengal Lounge; <1KM from hotel; booked using opentable. Overpriced, crappy food; our recommendation would be to avoid it

·         Walk to Royal BC Museum; there does not seem to be a IMAX movie aligned with our timings, but double check once

·         Fish and chips at Red Fish Blue Fish

·         Dinner from Tibetan Kitchen Cafe

 

Day 3

·         Check-out from hotel in the morning

·         Brunch at Fish Hook

·         Drive along Beach Drive; on hindsight, it would have been a better idea to do this on Day 1 after White Heather Team Room

·         Ferry back to Vancouver
